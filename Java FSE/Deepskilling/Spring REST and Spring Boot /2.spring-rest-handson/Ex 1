HTTP Request Response
What is HTTP Request and Response?
HTTP Request is the message sent by the client (usually a browser) to the server to ask for a resource.
It contains:
   Request line:
* Method: The action to perform (e.g., GET, POST)
* Resource: The URI/path being requested (e.g., /hello.txt)
* HTTP version: Protocol version used (e.g., HTTP/1.1)
   Headers: Additional info about the client or request (e.g., User-Agent, Host, Accept- Language)
   Body: Optional, mainly in POST or PUT requests (not in GET usually)
HTTP Response is the server’s reply to the client’s request. It contains:
   Status line:
* HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1)
* Status code (e.g., 200 means OK/success)
* Reason phrase/message (e.g., OK)
   Headers: Metadata about the response (e.g., Date, Server type, Content-Type, Content- Length)
   Body: The actual content requested (e.g., HTML, JSON, image bytes)
